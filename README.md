# Grafana data source plugin 

This is a Grafana back end data source.  It is intended for use with data sets from a Hioki data logger.  

Details TBD on how to inject the logger data so the plugin can see it.

## Getting started

### Building the plugin

This text is boilerplate from the plugin SDK and needs to be updated to instruct on how to install on 
Keck systems.

1. Update [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/key-concepts/backend-plugins/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go) dependency to the latest minor version:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. Build plugin backend binaries for Linux, Windows and Darwin:

   ```bash
   mage -v
   ```

3. List all available Mage targets for additional commands:

   ```bash
   mage -l
   ```

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   npm run test

   # Exits after running all the tests
   npm run test:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Playwright)

   ```bash
   # Spins up a Grafana instance first that we tests against
   npm run server

   # If you wish to start a certain Grafana version. If not specified will use latest by default
   GRAFANA_VERSION=11.3.0 npm run server

   # Starts the tests
   npm run e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   npm run lint

   # or

   npm run lint:fix
   ```
